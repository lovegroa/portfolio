            This version playable here has been recreated as a React component.
            This transition presented numerous challenges. One of the primary
            issues was managing the render lifecycle. It was essential for me to
            track the user input without triggering a rerender immediately, then
            applying the move the next time the interval ticked, which would, in
            turn, cause a rerender. This challenge deepened my understanding of
            how refs work in React.

            Interestingly, the pathfinding algorithm I employed is known as
            Dijkstra's algorithmâ€”though I wasn't aware of this during
            development. This algorithm determines the shortest path in a
            weighted graph. Beginning from an initial node, it iteratively
            selects the closest unvisited node, updating the distances of
            neighboring nodes, until every node has been visited. In this game's
            context, the nodes represent the corners and the sprites.

            This is a tool that I have recreated three times, the first
            iteration was built using PHP with SQL. The second was built using
            Python, Flask, Django and MongoDB and currently it is running with
            React, MUI and Firebase. The site uses Redux to manage almost all of

            The tool allows the user to simply manage their cashflow. The user
            can set a target and see how much disposable cash they have to
            spend. This is a tool built out of personal need.
