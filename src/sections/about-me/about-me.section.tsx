          While I've predominantly been a Full Stack Engineer, I've grown fond
          of Frontend development and aspire to specialise in this domain over
          the next few years. The rapid advancements in frontend technologies
          captivate me. Some frameworks and tools I'm eager to play with include
          the T3 stack, Astro, and Bun.
